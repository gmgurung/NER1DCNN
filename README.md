# NER1DCNN
This is a work done by me and my teammate(Junkai Ge) on a project which is on Natural Entity Recognition using 1D CNN and comparing it with other base models such as simple RNN and MLP.

- NER is one of the most importaant task in NLP, we have used postional encoding to make sure that the model is able to learn the positional meaning of the words, and capture the semantics for better tagging.
- 1D CNN is known for being light weight in computation and is able to generalize quickly compared to other models on the same task but for smaller datasets.

Please, go through the code, i have tried explain all the preprocessing steps with comments on it and model building along with explanantion of different techniques used here.
